Tired of some Ruby Gem not building because of a Hoe dependency that it can't resolve?  Are you on Debian, and gem update --system is disabled?  Why jump through hoops to get some unwanted gem running?

Just fake Hoe

> git clone git://github.com/fizx/stfu-hoe.git
> cd stfu-hoe
> gem build hoe.gemspec
> sudo gem install hoe

Viol√†!
